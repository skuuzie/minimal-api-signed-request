More or less, a "signed request" is when an incoming http request is an authenticated one, but this time the client is also capable of generating the signature. Utilizing the principle of cryptographic hash.

This is an implementation demo using [ASP.NET Core Minimal API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/apis) (.NET 8.0) via a custom middleware.

Run command: `dotnet run` (zero dependencies)

General flow:
1. Get current unix timestamp in seconds (fetch to `X-Timestamp` header)
2. Sign the timestamp with a shared-key and the defined algorithm, in this case using `HMAC-SHA512`  (i.e. `HMAC_SHA512(key, timestamp)`)
3. Get the digest and hexstring it (fetch to `X-Signature` header)

The request is now signed and will pass through the middleware.

You have the freedom to cherry pick your verification variable other than timestamp.

This is useful if you want to protect/monitor certain endpoints from replay "attack", scraping efforts, and other security cases.

_no more "what happens if i change this parameter?" attack_ ðŸ˜…

However, it all depends on the signature generation complexity and frontend implementation. The more you obfuscate it, the better.
